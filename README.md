# ML-Deep-Dive
Machine Learning is a field that is rapidly expanding within recent years and as such, there are millions of things to learn about. I wanted to learn more about the scikit-learn package and have a deeper understanding on how to implement ML algorithms for future projects. I also had quite an interest in sentiment analysis and emotion speech analysis, both of which had hundreds of tutorials online. Thus, I decided to start with those areas while recording down my progress and keeping track of my files, just in case I need them in the future. 

## What is this repo about?
This repo consists of three seperate python files, each related to Machine Learning and explores my progress in the field. The first file **hello-iris.py** is basically the "Hello World" of Machine Learning where I learn about the basics of the scikit-learn package and use the iris dataset to train and test a model. This is a simple classfication model which utilizes different ML algorithms such as Decision Trees, Logistic Regression and K Nearest Neighbours. The accuracy of each algorithms are tested before using one of them to predict what a random sample might be. The second file **speech-analysis.py** is based on a tutorial by the Data-Flair website and essentially uses the RAVDESS dataset to train and test a model to see what emotions one might exhibit based on their speech. I thought it was an interesting project and wanted to see how it would be implemented. 

The final file, **feels-analysis.py**, is a simple sentiment analysis program which uses various reviews from yelp, amazon and imdb to train and test a model. The two ML algorithms I have chosen for this project are Logistic Regression and Multinomial Naive-Bayes, as I have a better understanding on how to use them. Both algorithms are trained and then tested with a ratio of 0.75:0.25 before their accuracies are then measured. These accuracies are then compared to see which had a better accuracy at predicting one's sentiment (whether it was positive or negative). The user can then insert a statement which would be analyzed to see if it was positive or negative. There are two ways for the user to input their statement, either by typing it out or speaking into a microphone. If the script predicts that the statement was negative, it will ask the user if they want to relax. The idea behind this program is that I would eventually develop a mental wellness app that allows user to speak or type how they feel about the day and the app would be able to calm/destress the user through seevral means, wether it be by listening to calming music or doing breathing exercises. I understand that there are various problems with this project and that this dataset might not be the best to use, thus future edits or updates are in order to make this a better script. 

## How do I run feels-analysis?
To run **feels-analysis**, simply download the file along with the "sentiment labelled sentences" zip folder and Quiet_Time mp3 file. Then, make sure they are all in the same folder before running it.
